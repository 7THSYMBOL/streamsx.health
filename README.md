# Streams Healthcare Analytics Platform

Welcome to the Streams Healthcare Analytics Platform!

Our goal is to make it easy to create real-time healtcare analytics application using IBM Streams.  We want our users to be able to rapidly develop, test and validate healthcare analytics. Researchers and clinicians should focus on the analytics part of an application, while the platform takes care of the necessary plumbing and infrastructure work.

This diagram shows what we think a typical Streams healtcare application will look like and its major components.  The blue boxes represent components that should be provided by the platform.  The purple box represents areas where our end-user should focus on.  (i.e. developing advanced analytics).  

For details on the design and roadmap of this platform, please refer to here:
